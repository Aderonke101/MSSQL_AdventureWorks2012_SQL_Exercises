# AdventureWorks2012 SQL Practice

This repository contains structured SQL practice queries based on Microsoft's AdventureWorks2012 sample database. It is designed to demonstrate a range of SQL skills using Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL). This repository also showcases my structured and in-depth SQL practice using Microsoft's **AdventureWorks2012** sample database. It covers essential to advanced SQL concepts in real-world scenarios, from filtering and aggregation to joins, subqueries, views, and window functions.

## 🔍 About the Project

The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of SQL using the AdventureWorks dataset, a rich and complex database that simulates a real company’s operations. I grouped and executed all queries in a single SQL file, well-organized by topic, for ease of use in **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** or **Visual Studio Code**.
